            android:text="After you select your gamemode and difficulty, to play, drag this character around the board and collect &quot;optimizers,&quot; which are the purple tiles. Your score will be shown in the thop left corner, where it will say &quot;Optimizers: 0/25&quot; The left number, 0, is your current score, and the right number, 25, is your goal. This goal is determined by your chosen difficulty level. Once you have reached this goal, a new tile will appear, cycling through the colors of the rainbow. Move your character to this tile to complete the level. There is more to the game than just this however, you must be careful not to have too many &quot;issues&quot; or you will loose. If you get 10 issues, its game over. How do you get issues? When colliding with orange, red, or magenta tiles, you may gain issues. Lets go over every tile type one by one. Green tiles are called &quot;safe'' tiles. They are the main path for you to navigate the board on, and they do nothing. Cyan tiles are &quot;fix&quot; tiles. Upon touching them, they will remove 1 issue from your issue count, but will disappear with a chance of generating a new one. Purple tiles are &quot;optimizer&quot; tiles. There are 6 of these tiles, and they always disappear and generate a new one when you collect one. As mentioned previously, these are how you gain score. Orange or yellow tiles are &quot;warning&quot; tiles. These give you one &quot;issue.&quot; These are the less severe tiles, and it is generally safe to use them as shortcuts, as long as you keep an eye on your issue count. Red tiles are &quot;error&quot; tiles. These add 2-3 issues, and make a few random tiles one stage worse, so orange turns to red, red either turns to black or white, black sometimes turns to magenta(more on black and magenta later). White tiles are &quot;tile bomb&quot; tiles. When hit, they explode, causeing several random tiles on the map to change to random tile types. They do not add issues but they make it much harder to navigate the map. Black tiles are &quot;crash&quot; tiles. These are an instant game over. Be careful around them, it is easy to accidentally clip a corner and loose from this tile. Magenta tiles are &quot;glitch&quot; tiles. These can only appear after hitting an error tile, or another glitch tile. If you hit this tile, you have a chance of gaining issues, and the glitch tiles may spread, creating new glitch tiles anywhere, like an infestation.\n\n\nThis app is still a work in progress, there may be bugs or unimplemented features right now, be mindful of that. \n"
